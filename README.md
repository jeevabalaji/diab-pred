## Overview

In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features such as Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI. The dataset used in this project has been obtained from Kaggle. "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage." A simple random forest classifier is used for prediction.

## Motivation

The motivation was to experiment with an end-to-end machine learning project and gain some insight into deployment platforms like Heroku. Diabetes is an increasingly growing health issue due to our inactive lifestyle. If it is detected in time then through proper medical treatment, adverse effects can be prevented. To help in early detection, technology can be used very reliably and efficiently. Using machine learning we have built a predictive model that can predict whether the patient is diabetes positive or not. This project also aims to contribute to society by addressing this health issue.


## Learning Objective

The following points were the objectives of the project. If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then I have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on a blog about this mini project and I'll update the link to the blog about all the points in detail later. (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

- Data gathering
- Descriptive Analysis
- Data Visualizations
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Modelling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

## Technical Aspect

- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
- A user has to input details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI, etc.
- Once all the fields' information is provided, the prediction is displayed on a new page.
